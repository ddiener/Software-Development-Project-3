Hello!

My name is Dylan Diener and I am the author of these programs. The classes that were unique and created
are compiled and placed in the edu.uga.cs1302.txtbuff package, and the program that
tests these classes is located in the edu.uga.cs1302.text package. There is javadoc documentation as
well as a separate folder containing the classes of the compiled programs.

Please let me know if there are any questions.
